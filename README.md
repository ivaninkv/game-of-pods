# Game of pods

The [Game of PODs](https://kodekloud.com/courses/game-of-pods/) is a FREE fun and challenging set of challenges to be played on Kubernetes.

Game of PODs makes learning and practicing your Kubernetes skills fun by providing you with a set of challenges. Such as to deploy new applications to a cluster, troubleshooting existing applications, troubleshooting and fixing security and network related issues within the cluster and many more.

The challenge portal opens in a new window. You are given an architecture diagram of the application to be deployed and a count down timer before which you must complete all tasks.

In this case we are working towards redeploying an application stack from scratch. In this case It happens to be a stack including Drupal and Mysql.

The architecture involves creating and configuring persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, deploying Drupal and mysql applications, configuring mysql-secret, and configuring the deployment to use the secret.
